    <div class="title">A Study of Study Habits, Social Media Usage, and Transportation Choices Among University Students</div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">1. Introduction</div>
        <p>Understanding student behavior is crucial for universities to allocate resources effectively and support student success. This report presents the findings of a small-scale survey investigating the study habits, social media usage, library utilization, and primary transportation modes of students at Muni University. The objective is to estimate key parameters of the student population and to critically evaluate the survey design and implementation process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">2. Methodology</div>
        
        <h3>2.1. Survey Design and Target Population</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Topic:</strong> Student study habits and related behaviors</li>
            <li><strong>Target Population:</strong> All undergraduate students enrolled at Muni University in the current academic year</li>
            <li><strong>Sampling Frame:</strong> An official list of all registered undergraduate students</li>
            <li><strong>Variables Measured:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>StudyHoursPerWeek: Quantitative (Continuous)</li>
                    <li>DailySocialMediaHours: Quantitative (Continuous)</li>
                    <li>UsesLibrary: Binary (Yes/1 or No/0)</li>
                    <li>PrimaryTransport: Categorical (Walk, Bicycle, PublicTransport, Private)</li>
                    <li>Faculty: Categorical (Science, Business, Education)</li>
                    <li>Year: Categorical (1, 2, 3, 4)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Sampling Method and Justification</h3>
        <p><strong>Chosen Method:</strong> Stratified Random Sampling</p>
        <p><strong>Justification:</strong> The student population is naturally divided into distinct subgroups (faculties: Science, Business, Education). These strata are likely to have different study habits and behaviors. Stratified sampling ensures that each faculty is proportionally represented in the sample, which increases the precision of the estimates for the entire population and allows for separate analysis of each faculty. This method reduces sampling error by guaranteeing representation from all key subgroups.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Sample Size Determination</h3>
        <p>The sample size for a proportion estimate can be calculated using the formula for a finite population:</p>
        <div class="calculation">
            n = [N × p(1-p)] / [(N-1) × (B²/z²) + p(1-p)]
        </div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>N = Population size (Assumed to be 5,000 students)</li>
            <li>p = Estimated proportion (0.5 for maximum variability)</li>
            <li>B = Desired margin of error (0.08 or 8%)</li>
            <li>z = Z-score for 95% confidence level (1.96)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
        <div class="calculation">
            n = [5000 × 0.5(1-0.5)] / [(5000-1) × (0.08²/1.96²) + 0.5(1-0.5)]<br>
            n = [5000 × 0.25] / [4999 × (0.0064/3.8416) + 0.25]<br>
            n = 1250 / [4999 × 0.001666 + 0.25]<br>
            n = 1250 / [8.33 + 0.25] = 1250 / 8.58 ≈ 145.7
        </div>
        <p>A sample size of <strong>146 students</strong> would be required. The provided dataset contains 60 responses, which meets the minimum requirement but is below the ideal calculated size.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">3. Results (Data Analysis)</div>
        <p>The collected sample of 60 students was analyzed. The descriptive statistics are presented below.</p>

        <h3>3.2. Key Findings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On average, students study for <strong>15.3 hours per week</strong> and spend <strong>3.7 hours per day</strong> on social media.</li>
            <li><strong>Science faculty students</strong> report the highest average study hours (17.4 hrs/week), significantly higher than Business (13.6 hrs/week) and Education (14.4 hrs/week) students.</li>
            <li>Just over half of the students (<strong>55%</strong>) report using the library for their studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking is the most common mode of transport</strong> (48%), followed by public transport (28%).</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">4. Discussion: Sources of Bias and Limitations</div>
        <p>Despite careful design, several potential sources of bias and limitations are present in this survey.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Non-Response Bias:</strong> The dataset of 60 respondents is smaller than the ideal sample size of 146. Students with particularly heavy workloads or those less engaged may have been less likely to respond, biasing the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurement Bias:</strong> The data relies on self-reported behavior. Students may overestimate study hours and underestimate social media use due to social desirability bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Sampling Frame Error:</strong> The assumption of a 5,000-student population and use of a perfect registrar list may not reflect reality, introducing coverage error.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Generalizability:</strong> The sample represents only Muni University and cannot be generalized to all university students.</li>
            <li><strong>Causality:</strong> This cross-sectional survey can identify associations but cannot establish causation.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="section-title">5. Conclusion</div>
        <p>This survey provides a useful snapshot of student behaviors at Muni University. The results indicate notable differences in study habits across faculties, with Science students studying the most. Library usage is moderate, and walking is the dominant transport mode. The analysis successfully demonstrates the application of stratified sampling and descriptive statistics.</p>
        <p>However, the conclusions are tempered by significant limitations, primarily the small sample size and the potential for self-reporting bias. For future research, a larger sample should be pursued, and efforts should be made to validate self-reported data to improve the accuracy and reliability of the findings.</p>
